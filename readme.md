# Time Test

#### This is a simple experiment I did that lead to some surprising results!

simply execute the time.sh (POSIX) in the root dir to test for yourself.
I also added dart for comparison

### RESULT
1. While C was the fastest almost always,
2. C and Rust suffered terribly iterating through huge numbers.
3. Dart and Go proved to be optimised for situations like that.
#### TL;DR
```
3.for_1000000000/
# Executing..

        sys       user      real
  C     0m0.000s  0m1.331s  0m1.332s
  Dart  0m0.000s  0m0.459s  0m0.459s
  Go    0m0.000s  0m0.231s  0m0.231s
  Rust  0m0.000s  0m21.346s  0m21.356s
```
Granted: Maybe they can and or have to be optimised with the 
quirks and special features of the respective languages but 
this test relies on the code being as similar as possible
